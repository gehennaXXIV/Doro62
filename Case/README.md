4th and 5th layer's **thickness** are interchangeable. I recommend getting Clear Acrylic for the first four layers (from bottom) amd get a 4.5mm Clear Matte / Frosted Acrylic Top to also help reduce fingerprints.

If you need bottom clearance for bigger batteries, you can add another middle layer, how tall the layer is up to you, just be sure to also add the length to your standoffs.

If you are building a non ZMK (no battery clearance needed, on/off switch not soldered) build, I recommend a 1x 5mm 2 - bottom, and 1x 5mm middle (instead of 2x, significantly decreasing keyboard height, you would only be using 10mm).
