4th and 5th layer's **thickness** are interchangeable. I recommend getting Clear Acrylic for the first four layers (from bottom) amd get a 4.5mm Clear Matte / Frosted Acrylic Top to also help reduce fingerprints.

If you need bottom clearance for bigger batteries, you can add another middle layer, how tall the layer is up to you, just be sure to also add the length to your standoffs.
